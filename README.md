# PizzaShop test

Create a simple web application for a pizza store that allows users to view pizza menu items, place orders, and track
the status of their orders.

Requirements:

## Data concerns

Implement a database schema to store pizza menu items. Each menu item should have the following fields:

- Id
    - Unique identifier for the pizza.
- Name
    - Name of the pizza.
- Description
    - Description of the pizza.
- Price
    - Price of the pizza.
- Toppings
    - One or more toppings on the pizza

## UI and business concerns

Implement a web UI that allows users to

- view the pizza menu
- select pizzas
- place orders
- track their order status.

Currently, this project was generated with Razor pages, but this should not limit you in your choice of UI technology,
choose whichever technology seems best / you prefer for this assignment.

The above functionalities might translate into the following pages:

- Home
    - Displays the pizza menu.
- Create order
    - Allows users to select pizzas, enter (simple) customer details, and place an order.
- Check order status
    - Displays the status of a specific order based on an order id.

## Bonus points

It would be nice that the solution has:

- Proper validation implemented on both the API and UI side to handle invalid data or missing fields
- Tests to prove that certain functionalities work
- Documentation that explains the setup procedures

## Tools

You can any source available. You can use the internet, you can also ask the interviewers or even their colleagues
questions.

## Time constraints

If you feel like you are running out of time, write comments on what the general next steps were going to be. This way
the interviewers can discuss further.
